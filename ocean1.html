<p><strong>THE OCEAN</strong> is a huge body of saltwater that covers about<u><big> 71 percent of Earth's surface.</u> </big>The planet has one global ocean, though oceanographers and the countries of the world have traditionally divided it into four distinct regions: the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and Arctic oceans.Although there is much more to learn, oceanographers have already made some amazing discoveries. For example, we know that the ocean contains towering mountain ranges and deep canyons, known as trenches, just like those on land.<u><strong> The peak of the world’s tallest mountain—Mount Everest in the Himalaya,</u></strong> measuring 8.84 kilometers (5.49 miles) high—would not even break the surface of the water if it was placed in the Pacific Ocean’s Mariana Trench or Philippine Trench, two of the deepest parts of the ocean.The ocean is a huge body of saltwater that covers about 71 percent of Earth's surface.

<p><u>The ocean is a huge body of saltwater</u> that covers about 71 percent of Earth’s surface. <mark style="background-color:pink">The planet has one global ocean, </mark>though oceanographers and the countries of the world have traditionally divided it into four distinct regions: the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and Arctic oceans. Beginning in the 20th century, some oceanographers labeled the seas around .Antarctica the Southern Ocean, and in 2021 National Geographic<i> officially recognized this fifth ocean.</i><u>Ocean temperatures depend on the amount of solar radiation reaching the ocean surface.</u> In the tropics, surface temperatures can rise to over 30 °C (86 °F). Near the poles where sea ice forms, the temperature in equilibrium is about −2 °C (28 °F). Deep seawater temperature is between −2 °C (28 °F) and 5 °C (41 °F) in all parts of the ocean.[6] Water continuously circulates in the oceans creating ocean currents. These directed movements of seawater are generated by forces acting upon the water, including temperature differences, atmospheric circulation (wind), the Coriolis effect and differences in salinity.[7] Tidal currents originate from tides, while surface currents are caused by wind and waves. Major ocean currents include the Gulf Stream, Kuroshio current, Agulhas current and Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Collectively, currents move enormous amounts of water and heat around the globe. <big>This circulation significantly impacts global climate and the uptake and redistribution of pollutants such as carbon dioxide</big> by moving these contaminants from the surface into the deep ocean.</p>
